##  This is the course project for the Developing Data Products class. It utilizes the following tools to offer a customized application: 
- Shiny: a platform for creating interactive R programs embedded into a web page to develop the application 
- RStudio Presenter: a presentation authoring tool is used to create the presentation

Source Data:
========================================================
####  The data for this project can be found on the Colorado Information Marketplace (data.colorado.gov), a repository of Colorado Open Data.  The dataset I used is "Colorado's Named Peaks greater than 14,000 feet above sea level" which can be accessed at: 

https://data.colorado.gov/Environment/Colorado-s-Named-Peaks-greater-than-14-000-feet-ab/9333-96ac

Here is a look at the first few rows of this dataset:


```
  Rank             Peak Elevation
1    1       Mt. Elbert     14440
2    2      Mt. Massive     14421
3    3      Mt. Harvard     14421
4    4      Blanca peak     14345
5    5    La Plata Peak     14336
6    6 Uncompahgre Peak     14321
```

Application Description:
========================================================
#### Assume that you enjoy climbing mountains and decide you will climb one of the 58 peaks in Colorado that are over 14,000 ft. 
### Directions for use:
#### Use the mouse and/or left and right arrow keys to control the slide bar on the left side of the screen and select the height you are willing to climb. The horizontal red line on the plot on the right side will track your progress up or down.  
### What if you select a height that matches one of Colorado's 14ers?  
#### The app will display a vertical blue line and a photo of that mountain 
### What if you select a height that doesn't match one of Colorado'w 14ers?
#### The app will display a message indicating that no mountains match your selected height.  

Application Execution:
========================================================

### I invite you to try the app now by clicking on this link:

### If this application has piqued your interest in climbing a Colorado 14er, much more information about various routes and the difficulty of each peak is available at: 
http://14ers.com 

### Climbing real 14ers can be dangerous. Thanks so much for taking the safe route and trying this app!
